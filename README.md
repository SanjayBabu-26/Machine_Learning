# Machine Learning Specialization Coursera
This repository contains all of the courses in the Machine Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The specialization is divided into three courses:
1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

Each course has its own dedicated folder with a number of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the concepts covered in the course.

## Course 1 : [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)


## Course 2 : [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)







## Course 3 : [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
